## What is SS340?
SS340, also known as "Cause and Effect", is a social sciences elective class at The Cooper Union ([syllabus](SS340_syllabus.pdf)). The class covered the theory and applications of econometrics, the field of economics that deals with finding causal relationships between things. Stata or Python can be used in the course, but I used Python and served as the Python TA. I took the course during the fall 2021 semester (my senior year) to meet part of my humanities and social sciences requirements. The topics covered in this course were:
* Review of Statistics
* Treatment Effects
* Randomized Control Trials
* Regression, including:
  * Single and Multivariate
  * Dummy Variables
  * Instrumental Variables
  * Difference in Differences
  * Fixed Effects

## What code is here?
This repo contains my work for the coding portions of the homework assignments ([HW 1](HW1), [HW 2](HW2), [HW 3](HW3), and [HW 4](HW4)). It also contains my code for the final course [project](Project). The homework and project folders have my code, the output figures (where applicable), and the assignments.

## Credits
All of the homework code presented in this repo is my own work. For the project, I worked with a partner and their code is credited at the start of the files.
